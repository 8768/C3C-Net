# C3C-Net
Understanding the distribution of crowd flow is crucial for optimizing intelligent transportation services such as ride-hailing and sharing-bike scheduling. A key element for these applications is the accurate and reliable prediction of origin-destination (OD) flows, which provide a detailed profile of how and when passengers enter and exit the service. Despite the interest in traffic prediction in recent years, OD flow estimation remains a challenging task for deep spatiotemporal networks due to the two unique characteristics: (i) City-wide OD human movements are quite sparse. OD flows between many region pairs could be zero over a long period, the data sparsity and representation is a problem for deep models, (ii) OD spatial relations are timesensitive and large-scale, and can affect region-level similarity, attractiveness, and pair-level correlation. To solve these issues, we propose a context-aware 3D criss-cross fusion network for city-wide OD crowd flow prediction (C3CNet). First, we design a novel two-stream representation framework, where a contextual-embedded pair stream and a geographical-based region stream maintain both OD and in/outflow distribution from generation/attraction and transaction perspectives while preserving dynamic contextual factors. The information involved for OD demands as data augmentation can help to solve the sparsity problem adaptively in the learning process. Then, the C3C-Net consists of several components during the learning process, such as 3D convolutional module and residual mechanism. In particular, a 3D criss-cross attention module to learn global multi-view spatiotemporal dependencies and heterogeneity simultaneously with high computing efficiency. We further propose a stream fusion attention module to enhance the model performance by combining multi-scale region and pair-level latent features.Evaluation on real-world crowd flow data demonstrates that our C3C-Net method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
